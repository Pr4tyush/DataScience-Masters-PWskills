    "The mean, median, and mode are all measures of central tendency that are used to describe the center of a dataset. However, they each have different characteristics and are used in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean is the sum of all the values in a dataset divided by the total number of values. It is a useful measure of central tendency when the data is normally distributed (or close to it) and there are no extreme outliers. The mean is affected by outliers and extreme values, so it may not be a good representation of the center of a dataset if these are present.\n",
    "\n",
    "The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in order of magnitude. It is a useful measure of central tendency when the data is skewed or has outliers, as it is not affected by extreme values in the same way as the mean. The median is often used in fields like income or wealth distribution, where a few high or low outliers can skew the mean and make it an inaccurate measure of central tendency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. It is a useful measure of central tendency when dealing with categorical data or discrete data that has a small number of possible values. The mode is not as commonly used as the mean or median, but it can provide valuable information about the most common value in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "To choose the best measure of central tendency for a particular dataset, it is important to consider the characteristics of the data, such as its distribution, presence of outliers, and type of data (continuous or discrete). In some cases, it may be appropriate to use more than one measure of central tendency to provide a more complete picture of the data."

    "In a Venn diagram, each set is represented by a circle, and the elements of each set are represented by points inside the circle. The overlapping parts of the circles represent the elements that are common to two or more sets. The size of the circles can be adjusted to indicate the size or frequency of the elements in the set.\n",
